# Mouse Jiggler

Mouse jiggler prevents your system from entering sleep mode, standby mode, or activating the screensaver by emulating mouse movements back and forth +-1 pixel every second along the X using a USB HID mouse gadget. Due to the mouse only moving back and forth 1 pixel, it should not interfere with normal user work.
